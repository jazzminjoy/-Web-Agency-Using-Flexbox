# -Web-Agency-Using-Flexbox
Simple mock Web Agency page using some Flexbox for the first time.

I decided not to use Flex for the header.
The project only uses HTML and CSS.

This is a project I created using only HTML and CSS. Along the way, I learned:
1) How to use Flexbox.
2) How to choose fonts and incorporate them.
3) How to use Visual Studio Code.
4) How to look up information when I got stuck.
5) How to get the footer to always display and to remain at the bottom.

I had pleasure in the completed project. I like the background colors I chose.
